			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="intro">I grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas.<span class="sentence"> It is a town pretty close to the Mexican border and is home to many beaches.</span> I have many fond memories of going to the beach, but nowadays the water is murky and brown.</p>
			<p>My favorite hobby is running. Now that I live in Nebraska, it is hard to practice this hobby outside. It is either snowing outside or it smells like the dog food factory.</p>
			<p>I have two pets: a dog and a cat. My dog's name is Sammy and he is the sweetest dog you will ever meet. My cat's name is Shelly and she is not the nicest, but she sure is cute.</p>
